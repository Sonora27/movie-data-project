# Movie Industry Data Analysis

## Introduction

Microsoft has decided that they want to enter the movie industry, but they do not know anything about this particular industry. They have tasked us with collecting data on box office revenue and asked us to make recommendations to them on what type of movies they should make based off that data.

Also, we are interested in testing the hypothesis made by comedian Seth Rogen recently that Comedy movies are not simply declining, they have just become bigger budget affairs.

To accomplish this, we scraped data off of BoxOfficeMojo using BeautifulSoup, cleaned it using Pandas, and made visualizations and conclusions using Matplotlib.

## Objectives

* Which genre of movie does the best at the box office?
* Is the Comedy genre in fact declining recently, relative to other genres?
* Has the correlation between budget and profit increased in recent years?
* Are big budget Comedies more successful now than in the past as Seth Rogen has suggested?



## Data Observations

### The Genres With The Most Revenue

* The best performing genres are Adventure, Sci-Fi, Action, and Fantasy.
* Drama is the worst performing genre while Comedy is a middling performer.

### Correlation Between Budget and Revenue by Year for All Genres

* There is in fact an increase in the correlation between budget and revenue for all genres in recent years.

* Certain genres such as Action and Adventure have always had a strong relationship between budget and revenue.
* Comedies did not used to have a strong relationship between budget and revenue, but that has recently changed.

## Conclusions and Recommendations for Microsoft

* If Microsoft is working with a large budget, they should make films in Action and Adventure since they have a higher budget revenue correlation. 
* Seth Rogen's hypothesis that Comedy movies need to have to big budgets in modern times in order to be successful appears to be supported by our data.
* Microsoft should capitalize on the current box office market inefficiency on Comedies by making a big-budgeted Comedy.
* They would have little competition in the genre and big-budgeted Comedies are experiencing much increased success recently.
* Finally, Microsoft should focus on big budget movies in general no matter the genre as the correlation between budget and worldwide revenue has been high in the 21st century.

## Future Work

* Are there any Comedy genre synergies that perform better at the box office than others?
* For example, does an Action Comedy generate better revenue at the box office than an Adventure Comedy?
* How well do certain genres perform at the box office within specified budget brackets?
